# Goodoof Engine

Welcome to **Goodoof Engine**, a fork of the Godot Engine designed to ensure that game developers can continue to create without the worry of potential changes to the Godot Engine's license or ethical guidelines. 
Goodoof Engine is a copy of the Godot repo that track changes to the repos and follow them while safeguarding against any future changes that may affect the development landscape. 

Our motto is: **"Make Games Not Politics."**
